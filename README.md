# Bill McCutchan

I'm currently attending [Case Western Reseve University's](http:cwru.edu) [Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.case.edu/coding/) studying full-stack web development and JavaScript.

In the past I've held several jobs in Information Technology: Programmer and Senior Analyst in IBM mid-range and main-frame environments.  And I've also been Network Manager for a multi-national corporation.  I enjoy coding and have dabbled with Java and web development over the years.

When not in school, I spend a lot of time at the [Summit County Humane Society](http://summithumane.org) playing with the dogs!
